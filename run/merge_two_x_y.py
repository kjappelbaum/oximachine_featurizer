"""
Merge two X/y. Takes care of reading two feature/label files, merges them and shuffels them
and writes them to new output directory.

Of course, I could also generalize to two lists of X and ys, respectively but this might lead
to even worse practices.

One big approximation of all of this is that all data fits into memory in once. But it should not be
hard to wrap it in Dask if this is not the case.
